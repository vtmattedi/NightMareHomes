# NightMareHomes

The NightMareHolmes App is a front end to the NightMare ecosystem allowing a user to control the Devices on the network from anywhere in the world in the palm of their hand.

## Funcionalities
The App was designed based on a grid of buttons and each of them has a functionality assigned to either a press or a long press. The buttons also display information relevant the each funcionality, like the AC temperature or the color of the led strip.
